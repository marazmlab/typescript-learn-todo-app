# Typescript-learn-todo-app

Simple app created for learn and practice typescript. Nothing fancy, but the next step in developing the technology stack.

## Project Overview

I wanted to focus on the basics of typescript, so I decided on very basic development and styling tools.

- TypeScript – for application logic
- HTML – for markup and structure
- plain CSS file – for simply styling
